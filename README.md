#Mozilla Study Groups

Welcome to [Open HHU Coders](https://openhhucoders.github.io/studyGroup/)'s Study Group project! This group is designed to bring everyone in the HHU community interested in improving their coding skills, enhancing their data analysis abilities, building new skills, and working in a collaborative environment together. We are a community-led group that's open to new ideas and here to work with you.

### Wait, What's a 'Study Group'?

We are partnering with the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/)'s Study Group project. Mozilla Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

## For Participants
* **Read the Code of Conduct:** This study group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
* **Watch this Repo:** Up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
* **Join our Slack Channel:** We use [Slack]() to connect and share resources and ideas (you can join by sending us an [email](mailto:nicolasschmelling@gmail.com) with your preferred email address and name). Once you joined the slack channel, please introduce yourself in the chat, tell us who you are, what you do, and a little bit about your motivation for joining the study group.
* **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you.
